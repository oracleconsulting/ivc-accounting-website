# CSS Production Fix - IVC Website

## The Problem
The website was showing as a black page with white lines and text in production, even though it worked locally.

## Root Cause
The project was using **Tailwind CSS v4 (alpha)** which has a different PostCSS configuration and wasn't building properly for production.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **PostCSS Configuration** (`postcss.config.mjs`)
```javascript
// BEFORE (Tailwind v4 alpha):
plugins: ["@tailwindcss/postcss"]

// AFTER (Stable v3):
plugins: {
  tailwindcss: {},
  autoprefixer: {},
}
```

### 2. **Package Dependencies** (`package.json`)
- Removed: `@tailwindcss/postcss: ^4` and `tailwindcss: ^4`
- Added: 
  - `tailwindcss: ^3.4.4` (stable version)
  - `postcss: ^8.4.38`
  - `autoprefixer: ^10.4.19`

### 3. **CSS Enhancements** (`app/globals.css`)
- Added missing `pulse-glow` animation
- Added explicit text color inheritance for all elements
- Ensured all styles use `!important` for black background

## Deployment Status
- **Latest Commit**: `317910e` - "Fix Tailwind CSS production build - downgrade to stable v3"
- **Build Status**: âœ… Successful
- **Files Changed**: 
  - package.json
  - package-lock.json
  - postcss.config.mjs
  - app/globals.css

## Expected Result
The website should now display correctly in production with:
- Pure black background (#000000)
- White text throughout
- Orange/purple gradient effects
- All animations working (float, glow, shimmer, etc.)
- Glassmorphism effects on cards

Railway should automatically redeploy with these fixes within 2-3 minutes.
