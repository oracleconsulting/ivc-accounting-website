# PE Translator Fix Summary

## Fixed Issues

### 1. White Text on White Background ✅
- **Problem**: Input fields had no text color specified, causing white text on white background
- **Solution**: Added `text-[#1a2b4a]` class to all input fields (navy blue text)
- **Also added**: `placeholder-[#1a2b4a]/50` for semi-transparent placeholder text

### 2. Enhanced Translation Dictionary ✅
- **Before**: 12 PE terms
- **After**: 35 PE terms
- Added common corporate jargon like "leverage", "pivot", "scale", "unlock value" etc.

## How the PE Translator Works

### Technology: **100% Frontend-Based**
- No backend API calls
- Pure JavaScript string replacement
- Instant translation in the browser

### Translation Process:
1. User types PE/corporate jargon into textarea
2. When "TRANSLATE TO REALITY" is clicked:
   - Text is converted to lowercase
   - Each PE term in the dictionary is replaced with its plain English translation
   - Translations are wrapped in `**` markers
   - These markers are converted to orange highlighted text in the output

### Example:
- **Input**: "We're excited about the synergies from this strategic acquisition"
- **Output**: "we're excited about the **we're firing people** from this strategic acquisition"

### Translation Dictionary Sample:
```javascript
{
  "synergies": "we're firing people",
  "leverage": "use debt or exploit",
  "pivot": "our first idea failed",
  "scale": "get bigger, usually worse",
  // ... 31 more terms
}
```

## Future Enhancement Ideas
1. Add more PE terms based on user feedback
2. Allow users to suggest new translations
3. Add a "reverse translator" (plain English to PE speak)
4. Save favorite translations
5. Share translations on social media
