          <p className="lead text-xl text-gray-700 mb-8">
            After helping hundreds of Essex businesses with their VAT returns, I've seen the same 
            costly mistakes repeated. Here's how to avoid them and potentially save thousands.
          </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-black text-[#1a2b4a] mb-4">1. Not Reclaiming VAT on Mileage</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Many Halstead and Essex business owners don't realize they can reclaim VAT on business 
          mileage. At 45p per mile, that's 7.5p per mile in VAT you could be reclaiming.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-6">
          <strong>Real Example:</strong> A Braintree-based consultant driving 10,000 business 
          miles annually was missing out on £750 in VAT reclaims every year.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-black text-[#1a2b4a] mb-4">2. Missing the Flat Rate Scheme Benefits</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The VAT Flat Rate Scheme can save Essex small businesses significant time and money. 
          Yet many don't even know it exists.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-6">
          <strong>How it works:</strong> Instead of calculating VAT on every transaction, you pay 
          a fixed percentage of your gross turnover. For many Essex businesses, this means less 
          admin and more cash in your pocket.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-black text-[#1a2b4a] mb-4">3. Incorrect VAT Treatment on Mixed Supplies</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Essex businesses often get confused about VAT rates when selling different types of 
          goods or services together.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-6">
          <strong>Common mistake:</strong> A Colchester restaurant charging 20% VAT on takeaway 
          food (should be 0% for cold food) or a Chelmsford retailer not applying the correct 
          rate to different product categories.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-black text-[#1a2b4a] mb-4">4. Not Claiming VAT on Pre-Registration Expenses</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          When you register for VAT, you can claim back VAT on certain expenses from up to 4 
          years before registration.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-6">
          <strong>What you can claim:</strong> VAT on stock, equipment, and services that you 
          still own or use in your business. Many Essex businesses miss this opportunity.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-black text-[#1a2b4a] mb-4">5. Ignoring Partial Exemption Rules</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          If your Essex business makes both VATable and exempt supplies, you need to understand 
          partial exemption rules.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-6">
          <strong>Why it matters:</strong> You can only claim VAT on costs that relate to your 
          VATable supplies. Many businesses claim too much or too little, leading to HMRC 
          investigations.
        </p>
