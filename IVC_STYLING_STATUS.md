# IVC Website Styling Fix Status

## Issue
The website was showing with white background and black lines instead of the intended dark theme with gradients.

## Fix Applied
1. **Updated `app/globals.css`**:
   - Forced dark theme by removing `prefers-color-scheme` dependency
   - Added explicit black background with `!important` flags
   - Set root CSS variables for consistent dark theme
   - Added CSS reset to ensure no default margins/padding

2. **Verified `app/layout.tsx`**:
   - Already has `className="dark"` on html element
   - Body has `bg-black text-white min-h-screen` classes

3. **Verified `tailwind.config.js`**:
   - `darkMode: 'class'` is properly configured

4. **Verified Components**:
   - Hero section has `bg-black` class
   - All components use proper dark theme classes

## Deployment
- Changes pushed to GitHub at commit `60f4378`
- Railway will auto-deploy within 2-3 minutes
- The website should show with:
  - Pure black background
  - White text
  - Orange/purple gradient accents
  - Glassmorphism effects on cards

## Testing
After deployment completes, verify:
1. Background is pure black, not white
2. All text is white/light gray
3. Orange gradient effects are visible
4. Stats cards have glassmorphism effect
5. No white sections or lines
